eea stands for Energy and Environmental Accounting.

This repo includes code and partial data (links to public data are included)
for doing analysis on energy and environmental accounts using the Leontief
framework.  It also contains code to construct a version of these accounts
for the United States.

Warning: this is "research quality" code, which means it is completely
undocumented and only works in very specific settings.  Also the only way
to see results right now is through the LaTeX tables and GNUPlot code it
generates.

Nevertheless, if you find this repo and have any interest in the contents,
please drop me a line.
