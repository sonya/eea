eea stands for Energy and Environmental Accounting.

This repo includes code and partial data (links to public data are included)
for doing analysis on energy and environmental accounts using the Leontief
framework.  It also contains code to construct a version of these accounts
for the United States.

Currently the code is completely undocumented and of extremely poor quality,
since it was written mostly with the ultimate goal of generating LaTeX tables
and GNUPlot code for inclusion in a dissertation.

Nevertheless, if you find this repo and have any interest in the contents,
please drop me a line.
